### Data Science Interview Challenge

For the past few years, TCB Analytics has been hiring data scientists based on their own methodology which utilizes a "one-size-fits-all" series of "open-ended" data analysis challenges which allow for different ways of answering questions given each respective individual's unique background and experience. 

The challenges include the following four questions regarding the dataset: 

  1) Which brewery produces the strongest beers by alcohol beverage percent?
  2) If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
  3) Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?
  4) If I enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?
